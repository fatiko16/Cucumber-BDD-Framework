Folder Structure
===
Our main package takes place under test package, it should have your project name. 

  In our main package, we have 4 different packages. Pages, runners, step_definitions,
and utilities. Pages package has the page object classes, runners package has our runner classes this is where
we trigger our framework, step_definitions has implementation of our code for running the driver,
and utilities package is used for general utility classes.
    
Also under test package, there is a resources file, and under it we have our features directory for our feature files.

Finally, we have a configuration.properties file right under our root file.

Dependencies
====
Selenium
---
```java
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.seleniumhq.selenium/selenium-java -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
            <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
            <version>3.141.59</version>
        </dependency>
```
  Selenium is defined as "Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the automation of web browsers." in its [official 
website](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/). It is basically the tool we automate browsers with for test automation.

WebDriver Manager
---
```java
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.github.bonigarcia</groupId>
            <artifactId>webdrivermanager</artifactId>
            <version>4.3.1</version>
        </dependency>
```

Normally, to use some browsers like Firefox,Safari,Chrome etc. we have to download their drivers which is 
their binary files that let WebDriver to handle the specific browser. It is cumbersome effort, and you have
to check new versions of driver manually. WebDriverManager can be used to make this process easier for us to
download any kind of Driver. For example:
```java
  WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
  WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
```
